# Singapore Skills

A curated collection of AI skills for Singapore-focused work.

This repository is building practical, reusable skills for local contexts across public policy, open data, transport, business, citizen services, and more.

## Why this repo exists

Most generic AI prompts miss Singapore-specific context and source reliability needs. These skills encode repeatable workflows so outputs are:

- locally relevant
- source-backed
- concise and usable
- easy to share across tools

## Skills in this collection

All public skills live under `skills/public/`.

Examples currently included:
- `sg-skill-creator`
- `sg-weather-now`
- `sg-hdb-bto-announcements`
- `sgcarmart`

As new Singapore-context skills are added, they are part of this same collection.

To quickly list current source skills:

```bash
find skills/public -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type f -name "SKILL.md" | sed 's|/SKILL.md||' | sort
```

## Repo structure

```text
skills/public/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md
  agents/openai.yaml
  references/

ports/
  install.sh
  install-from-github.sh
  scripts/convert-skill.sh
  README.md
  universal/
```

## Contribution Flow (Source-Only)

Contributors should create or update only source skill files under `skills/public/<skill-name>/`.

Required files:
- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/openai.yaml`
- `references/*`

Optional frontmatter (recommended for clearer website credits):
- `author_name`
- `author_github`

Do not manually maintain `ports/claude`, `ports/gemini`, or `ports/universal` files in PRs.
Those are generated from source.

Full contributor guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Automation Flow

This repo auto-handles portability ports:

1. Pull request touching `skills/public/**`
- Workflow `ports-sync.yml` runs validation and regenerates ports in CI.

2. Merge/push to `main`
- Same workflow regenerates ports and auto-commits changes under `ports/` when needed.

3. Website sync (separate repo)
- `SGSkills-Website` syncs this repo into `vendor/SGSkills` and updates website metadata.
- This is configured in `SGSkills-Website/.github/workflows/sync-sgskills.yml`.

## Install for Codex

### Install one skill

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R skills/public/sg-skill-creator ~/.codex/skills/
# or
cp -R skills/public/sg-weather-now ~/.codex/skills/

Restart Codex after install.

### Install from your website (copy-paste one command)

Users can install directly from GitHub without cloning first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagatees/SGSkills/main/ports/install-from-github.sh | bash -s -- all
```

Single-skill variants for copy buttons:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagatees/SGSkills/main/ports/install-from-github.sh | bash -s -- sg-skill-creator
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagatees/SGSkills/main/ports/install-from-github.sh | bash -s -- sg-weather-now
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagatees/SGSkills/main/ports/install-from-github.sh | bash -s -- sg-hdb-bto-announcements
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagatees/SGSkills/main/ports/install-from-github.sh | bash -s -- sgcarmart
```

## Example prompts

- `Use $sg-weather-now and summarize Singapore weather now, next 2 hours, and next 24 hours with confidence labels and official source links.`
- `Use $sg-skill-creator to create a new Singapore-first skill with trusted-source rules, confidence labels, and website-ready metadata.`
- `Use $sg-hdb-bto-announcements and explain the latest BTO process in simple steps with official source links.`
- `Use $sgcarmart to compare 5 Singapore used-car listings with value signals, risk flags, and negotiation points.`

## Cross-platform ports

See `ports/README.md` for using prompt ports in other tools.

### Local install for other LLM tools

From repo root:

```bash
chmod +x ports/install.sh
./ports/install.sh claude ~/my-project all
./ports/install.sh gemini ~/my-project all
./ports/install.sh universal ~/Desktop all
```

Single-skill examples:

```bash
./ports/install.sh claude ~/my-project sg-weather-now
./ports/install.sh gemini ~/my-project sg-weather-now
./ports/install.sh universal ~/Desktop sg-weather-now
```

### Convert any skill to other LLM formats

Regenerate Claude + Gemini + Universal adapters from source skills:

```bash
./ports/scripts/convert-skill.sh all
# or one skill
./ports/scripts/convert-skill.sh sg-hdb-bto-announcements
./ports/scripts/convert-skill.sh sgcarmart
```

Ports are generated from source skills. Contributors should update `skills/public/<skill>/` only; CI auto-syncs ports on `main`.
